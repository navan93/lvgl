# Initialisation functions to be called by sysinit() during startup.
# Mynewt consolidates the initialisation functions into sysinit()
# and calls them according to the Stage number, highest number first.
# Stage 500 is used by Sensor Creator so we use Stage 600 onwards.
# Generated sysinit() for Bootloader: bin/targets/nrf52_boot/generated/src/nrf52_boot-sysinit-app.c

pkg.init:
    # pinetime_lvgl_mynewt should be initialised last, when SPI and Semihosting Console are up
    pinetime_lvgl_mynewt_init: 900  # Call pinetime_lvgl_mynewt_init() to initialise LVGL
